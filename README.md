# E-Banking UI Effects Project

This project is a side project I developed to explore dynamic UI effects in an e-banking context using vanilla JavaScript and CSS variables. It includes a login screen, toggles to change display themes and tabbed interface with responsive design and CSS animations. I also implemented transaction and load request simulations for realistic user testing scenarios.
